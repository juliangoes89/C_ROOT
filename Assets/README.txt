[SET-UP]

There is no initial set-up! The template will work out of the box, just hit the Play button to get going.

[EDITING THE CODE]

All scripts come fully commented, just find a script you would like to edit and take a look through the 
comments. You should hopefully find it easy to understand and make changes to.

[EXAMPLE: ADDING A NEW ENEMY]

The template comes with two enemy prefabs out of the box, both with different weapon and movement types. To 
create your own enemy you can start with duplicating one of the existing prefabs and modifying the properties 
in the inspector. Out of the box you can edit the following using only the inspector:

Sprite
Weapon Type (Standard Fire or Homing Missile)
Movement Type (Chase Player or Standard Movement)
Movement Speed
Firing Rate

Using these alone its possible to create a number of new combinations of enemies, for those of you wishing to 
delve deeper and create new weapon and movement types you can build upon the existing fully commented code 
provided.
